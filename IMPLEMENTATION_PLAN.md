# Implementation Plan for Optimizations 1-5, 8, 9, 10

## Priority Order

1. **Adaptive Search Strategy** (#1) - 60% faster, easiest to implement
2. **Auto-Detect Load Stability** (#2) - Better UX, medium complexity
3. **Real-Time Progress Updates** (#3) - Better feedback, requires web updates
4. **Load Point Validation** (#9) - Quality assurance, medium complexity
5. **Auto-Detect Load Points** (#8) - Advanced UX, higher complexity
6. **CSV Conversion Streaming** (#5) - Performance improvement, medium complexity
7. **Integrated 5-Point Calibration Workflow** (#4) - Major feature, high complexity
8. **Gradient-Based Search** (#10) - Advanced algorithm, highest complexity
